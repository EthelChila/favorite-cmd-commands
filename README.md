ls Command
I like the ls command because it helps me easily navigate  folders when I am not so sure of the content I have in a particular folder.Another good thing about ls is when usedtogether with -a (ls -a) even allows me to see hidden files, ls also has another part that I like which is being able to see more information which includes the name of the user who owns each item in the directory when is used with -l (ls -l).
Cat
I also like the cat command because not only is it easy to remember because of its name but like ls cat deplays the content of a file. Cat can also be used to copy content from one file to another.
mkdir
I like mkdir because so far since I started learning how to use command line I think I have used it the most after cd. Creating folders has never been so easy
cd
So far I think I have used cd the most since I started using command line,it can be ussd in different ways. It makes navigating through folders  very easy because you can easily  change from the current directory you are in to another.The name 'cd' is also quite easy to remember. When cd is used with .. it takes you back to the previous directory. The other cool thing about it is that you can use it with the home symbol which takes you straight back to the home page like this cd ~
